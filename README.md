# MZI-Mesh-Optimization-Simulations

MZM_Simulation_Optimization
Jupyter notebook file "MZM QD Optimization Circuit Final Version" includes the class structure used to simulate QD phase shifter Mach-Zehnder meshes with imperfections, as well as code for generating random unitaries, and examples on how to run the class structure including with/without numba.

Imperfections included are nanophotonic loss, beam splitter error and QD imperfections including: QD loss, dephasing and spectral diffusion

For running CNOT and CZ simulations Jacob Ewaniuk's quotonic package needs to be installed and find_Unheralded_CNOT/find_Unheralded_CZ need to be included in the folder with the notebook file.

Data collected from simulations for Adam McCaw's Master's thesis and the paper "Reconfigurable Quantum Photonic Circuits Based on Quantum Dots" is included in the Final Data folder.
