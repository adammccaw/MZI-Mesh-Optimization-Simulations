# MZI-Mesh-Optimization-Simulations

MZM_Simulation_Optimization
Jupyter notebook file "MZM QD Optimization Circuit Final Version" includes a class structure used to simulate QD phase shifter Mach-Zehnder meshes with imperfections, as well as code for generating random unitaries, and examples on how to run the class structure including with/without numba.

Imperfections included are nanophotonic loss, beam splitter error and QD imperfections including: QD loss, dephasing and spectral diffusion

For running CNOT and CZ simulations we require a package from the Queen's Quantum Nanophotonics Lab, which for protection of intellectual property has not been included here.

This code was used for the results displayed in Adam McCaw's Master's Thesis:
"Imperfect Quantum Photonic Integrated Circuits With Quantum Dot Phase Shifters"

It was also used for the results of the paper; "Reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits based on quantum dots", published in Nanophotonics - (https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/nanoph-2024-0044/html)
